    "# Lab 5: Principal components\n",
    "### Amy Nguyen\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many perspectives on principal components analysis (PCA). PCA is variously described as: a dimension reduction method; a method of approximating covariance structure; a latent model; a change of basis that optimally describes covariation; and so on. How can these seemingly distinct views be compatible with a single method?\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple answer is that PCA has a very wide range of applications in which it serves different purposes. Sometimes it is applied to find a few derived variables based on a large number of input variables -- hence, 'dimension reduction'. At others, it is used to interpret covariation among many variables -- hence, a 'covariance approximation'. With different objectives come different perspectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "In PSTAT100, we'll try to look beyond this and focus on the core technique of PCA: *finding linear data transformations that preserve variation and covariation*. In short, we'll focus on the *principal components* (PC) part of PCA, taking the following view.\n",
    "* **Principal components** are _**linear data transformations**_. \n",
    "* The **analysis** of principal components is _**varied depending on the application**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll keep an open mind for the time being about what the analysis (A) part of PCA entails. So, what does it mean to say that 'principal components are linear data transformations'? Suppose you have a dataset with $n$ observations and $p$ variables. As a dataframe, this might look something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation | Variable 1 | Variable 2 | $\\cdots$ | Variable $p$\n",
    "---|---|---|---|---\n",
    "1 | $x_{11}$ | $x_{12}$ | $\\cdots$ | $x_{1p}$\n",
    "2 | $x_{21}$ | $x_{22}$ | $\\cdots$ | $x_{2p}$\n",
    "$\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ |  | $\\vdots$\n",
    "$n$ | $x_{n1}$ | $x_{n2}$ | $\\cdots$ | $x_{np}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent the values as a data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ with $n$ rows and $p$ columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{X} \n",
    "= \\underbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\n",
    "    \\mathbf{x}_1 &\\mathbf{x}_2 &\\cdots &\\mathbf{x}_p\n",
    "    \\end{array}\\right]}_{\\text{column vectors}}\n",
    "= \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\n",
    "    x_{11} &x_{12} &\\cdots &x_{1p} \\\\\n",
    "    x_{21} &x_{22} &\\cdots &x_{2p} \\\\\n",
    "    \\vdots &\\vdots &\\ddots &\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "    x_{n1} &x_{n2} &\\cdots &x_{np}\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To say that the principal components are linear data transformations means that each principal component is of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{PC} = \\mathbf{Xv} = v_1 \\mathbf{x}_1 + v_2 \\mathbf{x}_2 + \\cdots + v_p \\mathbf{x}_p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a linear combination of the columns of the data matrix. In PCA, the linear combination coefficients are known as *loadings*; the PC loadings are found in a particular way using the correlations among the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll focus on computing and interpreting principal components:\n",
    "* finding the loadings (linear combination coefficients) for each PC;\n",
    "* quantifying the variation captured by each PC;\n",
    "* visualization-based techniques for selecting a number of PC's to A(nalyze);\n",
    "* plotting and interpreting loadings. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you'll encounter a few ways that PCA is useful in exploratory analysis:\n",
    "* describing variation and covariation;\n",
    "* identifying variables that 'drive' variation and covariation;\n",
    "* visualizing multivariate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work with a selection of county summaries from the 2010 U.S. census. The first few rows of the dataset are shown below:"

    "While direct inspection is useful, it can be cumbersome to check correlations for a large number of variables this way. A heatmap -- a colored image of the matrix -- provides a (sometimes) convenient way to see what's going on without having to examine the numerical values directly. The cell below shows one way of constructing this plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the color scale shows positive correlations in orange, negative ones in blue, strong correlations in dark tones, and weak correlations in light tones. This is known as a 'diverging color gradient', and should, as a rule of thumb, always be used for plots of this type."

    "Principal components analysis (PCA) consists in finding variable combinations that capture large portions of the variation and covariation in one's dataset. \n",

    "'Variable combinations' here means *linear* combinations. That is, if again $x_{ij}$ denotes the data value for the $i$th observation and the $j$th variable, the value of a principal component is of the form:\n",

    "$$\\text{PC}_{i} = \\sum_j w_j x_{ij} \\quad(\\text{value of PC for observation } i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights $w_j$ for each variable are called the *loadings*. The loadings tell which variables are most influential (heavily weighted) in each component, and thus offer an indirect picture of which variables are driving variation and covariation in the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll look at how to:\n",
    "* compute the full set of principal components;\n",
    "* determine the variation they capture;\n",
    "* select a subset of principal components for analysis;\n",
    "* and examine the loadings.\n",

    "Look first at PC1: the variables with the largest loadings (points farthest in either direction from the zero line) are Child Poverty (positive), Employed (negative), Income per capita (negative), Poverty (positive), and Unemployment (positive). We know from exploring the correlation matrix that employment rate, unemployment rate, and income per capita are all related, and similarly child poverty rate and poverty rate are related. Therefore, the positively-loaded variables are all measuring more or less the same thing, and likewise for the negatively-loaded variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, then, PC1 is predominantly (but not entirely) a representation of income and poverty. In particular, counties have a higher value for PC1 if they have lower-than-average income per capita and higher-than-average poverty rates, and a smaller value for PC1 if they have higher-than-average income per capita and lower-than-average poverty rates.\n",

    "Often interpreting principal components can be difficult, and sometimes there's no clear interpretation available! That said, it helps to have a system instead of staring at the plot and scratching our heads. Here is a semi-systematic approach to interpreting loadings:\n",

    "1. Find the largest positive loading, and list all variables with similar loadings.\n",

    "4. Try to come up with a description of less than 4 words.\n",
